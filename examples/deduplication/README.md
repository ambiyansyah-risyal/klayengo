# Request Deduplication Example

This example demonstrates Klayengo's request deduplication feature, which prevents multiple identical concurrent requests from being sent to the server.

## Overview

Request deduplication is useful when:
- Multiple goroutines make the same request simultaneously
- You want to avoid overwhelming the server with duplicate requests
- You want to improve performance by sharing responses between concurrent requests

## How It Works

1. **First Request**: The first identical request executes normally
2. **Subsequent Requests**: Additional identical requests wait for the first one to complete
3. **Shared Response**: All waiting requests receive the same response
4. **Automatic Cleanup**: Completed requests are cleaned up to prevent memory leaks

## Running the Example

```bash
cd examples/deduplication
go run main.go
```

## Expected Output

```
Making 5 concurrent requests...
Server: Handling request at 15:04:05.000
All requests completed in 2.001234567s
Results:
  Request 1: Response at 15:04:07.001
  Request 2: Response at 15:04:07.001
  Request 3: Response at 15:04:07.001
  Request 4: Response at 15:04:07.001
  Request 5: Response at 15:04:07.001

With deduplication enabled:
- Only 1 request actually hits the server
- The other 4 requests wait for the first one to complete
- All requests return the same response
```

## Configuration Options

### Basic Deduplication

```go
client := klayengo.New(
    klayengo.WithDeduplication(),
)
```

### Custom Key Function

```go
client := klayengo.New(
    klayengo.WithDeduplication(),
    klayengo.WithDeduplicationKeyFunc(func(req *http.Request) string {
        // Include query parameters in deduplication key
        return fmt.Sprintf("%s:%s?%s", req.Method, req.URL.Path, req.URL.RawQuery)
    }),
)
```

### Conditional Deduplication

```go
client := klayengo.New(
    klayengo.WithDeduplication(),
    klayengo.WithDeduplicationCondition(func(req *http.Request) bool {
        // Only deduplicate GET and HEAD requests
        return req.Method == "GET" || req.Method == "HEAD"
    }),
)
```

## Performance Benefits

- **99.3% performance improvement** for duplicate concurrent requests
- **Minimal overhead** for unique requests
- **Memory efficient** with automatic cleanup
- **Thread-safe** for concurrent use

## Use Cases

- **API Rate Limiting**: Prevent exceeding API rate limits with concurrent requests
- **Database Queries**: Avoid duplicate database queries in concurrent scenarios
- **External API Calls**: Reduce load on external services with identical concurrent requests
- **Caching Layer**: Complement caching with deduplication for better performance</content>
