## Security Best Practices

When using Klayengo in production:

1. **Keep dependencies updated** - Regularly update to the latest version
2. **Use HTTPS** - Always use HTTPS for API communications
3. **Monitor logs** - Enable appropriate logging levels for security monitoring
4. **Rate limiting** - Configure appropriate rate limits for your use case
5. **Circuit breaker** - Use circuit breaker to prevent cascading failures
6. **Input validation** - Validate all inputs before processing

## Known Security Considerations

- **Memory usage**: Cache can grow unbounded - set appropriate size limits
- **Rate limiting**: Default settings may not be sufficient for high-traffic scenarios
- **Metrics exposure**: Prometheus metrics may expose sensitive information
- **Debug logging**: Debug logs may contain sensitive information

## Security Updates

Security updates will be:
- Released as patch versions (e.g., 1.2.3 â†’ 1.2.4)
- Documented in release notes
- Marked with security advisories
- Backported to supported versions when applicable
