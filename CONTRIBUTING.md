- Follow Go naming conventions
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic

### Testing

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Aim for high test coverage (>90%)
- Use table-driven tests for multiple test cases
- Test error conditions and edge cases
- Run benchmarks for performance-critical code

### Documentation

- Update README.md for API changes
- Add examples for new features
- Document breaking changes
- Keep code comments up to date

### Performance

- Run benchmarks before and after changes
- Be mindful of memory allocations
- Consider concurrent performance
- Document performance implications
